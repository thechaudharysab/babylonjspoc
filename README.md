This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Tutorial Info

Medium Link:

There are three examples in this tutorial:

- **Loading a basic 3D model in our react-native app**
  This will set the base and will help you get the very basics of BabylonJS with React-Native.
- **Play pause animations on button press**
  Using a horse 3D model we'll play with animation where we can make the horse walk and jump.
- **Changing shirt and hairstyles of a 3D Model**
  Just like how in Sims game or main avatar creating apps we'll have a quick look on how to do it.

All the code is in one screen `App.tsx` comment/uncomment to load different examples.
